Working on V2 of the infinity choker.  V1 was the adafruit tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/infinity-mirror-collar

I lost V1 at burning man so I'm trying to make an updated version.

Ada fruit is sold out of the itsy bitsys so I got a trinket M0 and a QT PY.

I'm currently working off the trinket m0 because the QT PY was getting scary hot doing nothing.  I'm sad to lose the wireless capability.  Not sure how I will cycle through animations.  Using the serial console for now.

The trinket is also super finicky with circuit python so I had to use the Arduino IDE.
